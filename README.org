#+title: My glorious (.dot)files


Welcome to my personal and /Updated/ Dot files

* Dotfiles
Some configuration files here include:

- neovim (tui editor)
- doom emacs (gui editor)
- bspwm + KDE Plasma (the best of both worlds)
- more to come...

* Scripts
- Keys.sh (handy dandy script to map the useless CAPSLK key to ESC/CTRL)

* Dotfile Manager

#+begin_quote
Currently use [[https://yadm.io/][yadm]] to manage my dotfiles.
#+end_quote

* Todo list:
1. Add Awewsomewm config (not ready).
2. Create a bootstrap script to install all my configurations in all my machines painlessly..
3. Search a proper way to manage my walpapers and other things.
4. Stop being a lazy piece of shit.
